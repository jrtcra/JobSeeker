# Results from Heuristic Evaluation

Overall, our Heuristic evaluation of our mockup resulted in a success, continuing with our job application helper tool as well as the general user flow and UI/UX design. According to the evalutation, we decided to add the statistics and visual graphic elements into the main dashboard of our web app. This simply allows the user to see more input from our website and track their progress as they continue to fill out application entries. There was also a lot of positive feedback about our statistics page in general, so we added more functionality and visual elements than our mockup.

We had some other feedback for potentional functionality in the future including notifications for reminders, leveraging external APIs for company ratings, celebratory screens for completing a goal, etc. While useful, we didn't have enough time to complete these new features. However, these are jsut bonus features and the main flow and functionality of the app remains the same regardless.

# Comparison to Existing Apps

Our app is generally unique from existing applications. Most unemployed/underemployed people use apps like Google Sheets, Notion, or other similar document-style websites. These are not specifically geared towards job applications specifically, and thus take some background knowledge and technical skill to set up. Our website immediately has all of the database tools and visual elements ready for each user. It also removes a lot of visual clutter and other distractions as the website has a singular purpose. 

We are overall satisfied with our application as it is easy to use and start applying to jobs through JobSeeker. The sign-up process is straightforward, and the homepage is intuitive to use because it bares similarities to the other spreadsheet-style apps mentioned, without any unnecessary tools or functionality.
